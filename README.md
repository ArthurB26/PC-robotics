## [Ollama](https://github.com/ArthurB26/PC-robotics/tree/main/Ollama)
After doing some research on AI, we've experimented with Ollama to see its capabilities. Ollama is an open-source tool which can run AI models locally on a computer without needing an internet connection. Unfortunately, Ollama cannot be run on most school laptops/chromebooks due to its high hardware requirements. To counter this, we've looked into GitHub Codespaces, which is a virtual machine that can run Ollama. After some programming, we have created a Python script to chat with one of Ollama's language models - Llama 3.2.
