# Using an ESP32 with ArduinoIDE

## What are esp32's?
Esp32's are a small microcontroller produced by Espressif systems. They are a low cost, low power microcontroller.
The things that sets apart ESP32's from other micro controllers like an arduino:
  1. They are extremly low cost, you can buy one for around 10 NZD
  2. They have built in wifi and bluetooth.
  3. ESP32's can be anywhere from 10 to 60 times the performance and speed of a normal Arduino uno.
