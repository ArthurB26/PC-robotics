# Using an ESP32 with ArduinoIDE

## What are esp32's?

Esp32's are a small microcontroller produced by Espressif systems. They are a low cost, low power microcontroller.
The things that sets apart ESP32's from other micro controllers like an arduino:
  1. They are extremly low cost, you can buy one for around 10 NZD
  2. They have built in wifi and bluetooth.
  3. ESP32's can be anywhere from 10 to 60 times the performance and speed of a normal Arduino uno.

### You might notice that the chip on here looks familiar.
This is because the [Jack Board](https://www.jackbord.works/product-page/jackbord-basic) use the same chip on them, this is good because it means that you have likely already worked with ESP32's before

# Downloading the Arduino IDE

Arduino IDE is an Intergrated Development Enviroment which is just a fancy acronymm for a code editor. It is an app you can download and we will be using it for all of our coding and debugging.
## Steps to download:
### 1. Downloading the IDE

to download first we will have to go to: [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
then click on which ever platform you will be using in I will show mac and Windows
###On windows:
click on the __Windows *msi installer*__ file


_If you are prompted to donate just click **Just download**_

_then you might be asked to put in you email, just click **download** again.
